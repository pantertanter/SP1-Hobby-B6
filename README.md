A description of our business idea

Our business idea is to deliver a platform for connecting people across age, hobbies
and location, so that they(the customer) easily can socialize with other people of the same interest in a
relevant way, matching across the key entities in their lives.
Outside these mentioned goals, we aim to also provide matchmaking concerning similar careers and interest,
again making this a potent platform to connect.
